Credit Card Transaction and Customer Report using Power BI and SQL

# Credit Card Weekly Performance Tracker Dashboard
This project provides a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI to analyze key performance metrics and trends in credit card operations. It includes data integration from MySQL, data manipulation using DAX queries, and visualization of insights.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a real-time dashboard that allows stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively. Key insights such as transaction trends, revenue analysis, and customer behavior are visualized to aid decision-making processes.

### Key Features
- **Data Integration:** CSV data for credit card details and customer details were imported into MySQL.
- **Database Setup:** Created tables `CREDIT_CARD_DETAIL` and `CUSTOMER_DETAIL` in MySQL to store the imported data.
- **Data Manipulation:** Used DAX queries in Power BI to create new columns like age group, income group, calculate revenue, and percentage change of revenue from the previous week to the current week.
- **Dashboard Design:** Designed interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize key metrics such as revenue, transaction volumes, delinquency rates, and more.

## Key Insights
- **Revenue Analysis:** Overall revenue is $55M, with an interest of $7.84M and a total transaction amount of $45M.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Male customers contributed $31M in revenue compared to $26M from female customers.
- **Transaction Trends:** Blue & Silver credit cards accounted for 93% of transactions.
- **Geographical Analysis:** TX, NY, and CA contributed to 68% of transactions.
- **Performance Metrics:** Activation rate is 57.5%, and delinquency rate is 6.06%.

## Project Files
- **Data:** CSV files (`credit_card.csv` and `customer_details.csv`) containing raw data used in the project.
- **SQL Scripts:** SQL scripts used to create tables in MySQL for data storage.
- **Power BI Files:** Power BI file containing the dashboard designs and data visualizations.
- **Project PDF Files**
- **README:** This file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and key features.
